Elevator-System
Python-based elevator controller using SQLite
Elevator Management System

This project presents a Python-based Elevator Management System, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time elevator simulation. The system enables users to operate elevators—navigating between floors, opening and closing doors—with all activities systematically recorded in a SQLite database. The application harnesses `tkinter` for the GUI layer and integrates `sqlite3` for robust backend data management, offering a practical model for intelligent elevator control in multi-story buildings.
Key Features
- Interactive GUI for elevator movement and door operation
- Comprehensive activity logging with precise timestamps
- Multi-elevator support for complex environments
- Persistent data storage utilizing SQLite
- Rigorous input validation and error handling mechanisms

Technologies Employed
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (GUI development)
- SQLite (data storage)
- Datetime module (timestamp management)

Deployment Instructions
 Prerequisites
- Python installation
- Ensure `elevator.db` resides in the application directory
  bash
python elevator_system.py
